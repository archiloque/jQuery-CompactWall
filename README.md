# jQuery CompactWall

CompactWall is jQuery plugin that will organize a set of blocks to use the minimum vertical space.

It is a variation of the [masonry](http://masonry.desandro.com/) plugin to be used the vertical space is more important
than keeping the blocks ordered.

A more detailed documentation and some example can be found [here](http://archiloque.net/compactwall.html).

# Usage

    <div id="container">
      <div class="block">...</div>
      <div class="block">...</div>
      <div class="block">...</div>
      ...
    </div>

    $(function(){
      $('#container').compactWall({
        blockSelector: '.block'
      });
    });

Note that the blocks should have a know size to be reorganized, for example if you use images in your block you have
to specify their size in the css.
